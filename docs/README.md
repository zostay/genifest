## Deployment

The documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages at [genifest.qubling.com](https://genifest.qubling.com) when changes are pushed to the master branch.

### Manual Deployment

```bash
make docs-deploy
```

## Custom Domain Setup

To complete the custom domain setup for `genifest.qubling.com`:

1. **DNS Configuration** (external):
   ```
   genifest.qubling.com. IN CNAME zostay.github.io.
   ```

2. **GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
   - Set custom domain to `genifest.qubling.com`
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

The `docs/CNAME` file ensures the custom domain is preserved during deployments.

## Features

- **Material Design 3** theme with dark/light mode
- **Search** with highlighting and suggestions
- **Mermaid diagrams** for architecture illustrations
- **Code syntax highlighting** with copy buttons
- **Responsive design** for all devices
- **Git integration** for edit links and revision dates

## Documentation Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation:

### Content Organization

- **Getting Started**: Focus on user onboarding and quick wins. Keep content beginner-friendly.
- **User Guide**: Provide comprehensive how-to information for daily usage. Include practical examples.
- **Examples**: Create step-by-step tutorials with real-world scenarios. Use the guestbook example as a foundation.
- **Reference**: Maintain complete technical specifications. Keep API documentation up-to-date.
- **Development**: Document technical architecture and contributor workflows.

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language appropriate for technical audiences
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting (yaml, bash, go)
- Provide both conceptual explanations and practical examples
- Cross-reference related concepts using internal links
- Use consistent terminology throughout all documentation

### Material for MkDocs Features

The documentation site uses advanced MkDocs features:

- **Admonitions**: Use `!!! note`, `!!! warning`, `!!! tip` for callouts
- **Code blocks**: Include language hints for syntax highlighting
- **Tabbed content**: Use `=== "Tab Name"` for multi-option examples
- **Snippets**: Reference shared content with `--8<-- "includes/mkdocs.md"`
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Include architecture and flow diagrams
- **Search**: All content is automatically indexed and searchable

### Testing Documentation

Always test documentation changes locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
make docs-install

# Serve with live reload
make docs-serve

# Build and check for errors
make docs-build
```

### Cross-References and Navigation

- Link to related sections using relative paths: `[Configuration](../user-guide/configuration.md)`
- Update navigation in `mkdocs.yml` when adding new pages
- Ensure all internal links work correctly
- Use descriptive link text that provides context

## Contributing

1. **Edit content** in the `docs/` directory
2. **Test locally** with `make docs-serve` to verify formatting and links
3. **Check build** with `make docs-build` to catch any errors
4. **Submit PR** - documentation builds are tested automatically
5. **Deploy** happens automatically on merge to master

## Troubleshooting

### Dependencies Not Installing

```bash
# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build Failures

```bash
# Check for syntax errors
mkdocs build --strict

# Common issues:
# - Missing files referenced in nav
# - Invalid YAML front matter
# - Broken internal links
```

### Local Server Issues

```bash
# Kill existing process
pkill -f "mkdocs serve"

# Serve on different port
mkdocs serve --dev-addr=127.0.0.1:8001
```
