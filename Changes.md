## v1.0.0-rc5  2025-09-21

_Complete revamp of tag system with groups-based selection, multi-format support, enhanced value generation, and improved developer experience._

* **Groups-Based Tag System**: Revolutionary new approach to tag selection and organization

    * **Groups configuration** with customizable tag expression patterns for organizing changes
    * **Default "all" group** containing `["*"]` for backward compatibility with existing workflows
    * **Tag expressions** supporting wildcards (`*`), negations (`!tag-name`), and directory scoping (`dir:tag`)
    * **Expression evaluation** with sequential processing where later expressions override earlier ones
    * **Flexible matching** allowing complex combinations like `["*", "!secret-*", "secret-foo"]`

* **Enhanced CLI Argument Structure**: Modernized command-line interface with intuitive argument handling

    * **Zero arguments**: Uses "all" group in current directory (`genifest run`)
    * **One argument**: Group name in current directory OR directory path with "all" group
    * **Two arguments**: Specified group name in specified directory (`genifest run dev examples/guestbook`)
    * **Intelligent parsing** that distinguishes between group names and directory paths
    * **--tag option** for adding additional tag expressions to any group selection

* **Multi-Format Configuration Support**: Extended beyond YAML to support additional configuration formats

    * **TOML support** with complete read/write capabilities for `.toml` configuration files
    * **Format detection** automatically identifies file format from extension (`.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`)
    * **Universal processing** allows changes to be applied to any supported format
    * **Extensible architecture** in `internal/fileformat/` for future format additions
    * **Format-agnostic operations** with unified AST representation for all formats

* **Enhanced Value Generation System**: Expanded ValueFrom types with new capabilities

    * **Environment variable support** with new `envRef` type for reading environment variables
    * **Default value handling** for environment variables when not set or empty
    * **Transient changes in file inclusion** allowing temporary modifications during file embedding
    * **Document context preservation** for `documentRef` operations within included files
    * **Validation improvements** with filename context in error messages for better debugging

* **File Inclusion Enhancements**: Advanced file embedding with on-the-fly modifications

    * **Transient changes** apply modifications to included files without persisting changes to disk
    * **DocumentSelector support** for targeting specific documents in multi-document included files
    * **Tag-based filtering** allowing conditional application of transient changes
    * **Context-aware operations** preserving document references and variable scoping
    * **Non-destructive processing** ensuring original files remain unmodified

* **Directory-Scoped Tag Expressions**: Advanced scoping system for complex project structures

    * **Scoped expressions** using `<directory>:<tag-expression>` syntax for targeted rule application
    * **Automatic directory prefixing** when merging subordinate configurations
    * **Nested rule application** where child directory rules are applied after parent rules
    * **Path-aware matching** ensuring expressions only apply to appropriate directory contexts

* **Developer Experience Improvements**: Enhanced tooling and validation feedback

    * **Contextual error messages** with filename and path information for configuration validation
    * **Improved validation feedback** making debugging configuration issues significantly easier
    * **Enhanced documentation structure** with comprehensive guidance for contributors
    * **Cleaner CLI validation** with removal of redundant validation tips and warnings

* **Configuration Merging Improvements**: Enhanced configuration loading with groups support

    * **Groups merging** with proper directory scoping and inheritance
    * **Default groups** automatically provided when not specified in configuration
    * **Hierarchical merging** preserving parent-child relationships in nested configurations
    * **Context preservation** maintaining directory information throughout the merge process

* **Breaking Changes** (no backward compatibility for RC software):

    * **Removed --include-tags/--exclude-tags** in favor of groups-based selection
    * **New argument structure** requires explicit group names for non-default selections
    * **Groups section** now required for custom tag selection (defaults provided automatically)

* **Real-World Examples**:

    ```yaml
    groups:
      all: ["*"]                           # All tags (default behavior)
      config-only: ["config"]              # Only configuration changes
      no-secrets: ["*", "!secret-*"]       # Everything except secrets
      dev: ["config", "image", "!production"] # Development environment
      prod: ["*", "!dev-*", "!test-*"]     # Production with exclusions

    changes:
      - keySelector: ".database.host"
        valueFrom:
          envRef:                          # Read from environment variable
            name: "DB_HOST"
            default: "localhost"           # Fallback if not set

      - keySelector: ".spec.template"
        valueFrom:
          fileInclusion:                   # Include file with modifications
            source: "templates/base.yaml"
            changes:                       # Transient changes (not persisted)
              - keySelector: ".metadata.name"
                valueFrom:
                  default:
                    value: "custom-name"
    ```

* **Advanced Usage Patterns**:

    ```bash
    genifest run                          # All changes (default group)
    genifest run config-only             # Only config changes
    genifest run dev examples/app        # Dev group in specific directory
    genifest run --tag "!secret" prod    # Add negation to prod group

    # Multi-format support
    genifest run --include-tags toml     # Process TOML configuration files
    ```

## v1.0.0-rc1  2025-08-18

_This is a complete rewrite of genifest, removing all the old cruft and making it more flexible._

* The primary configuration file is now named `genifest.yaml` and must be in the same directory that the `genifest` binary is run.
* The system supports three top-level types of configuration files: manifests, files, and scripts.

     * Manifests are for YAML files organized into application sub-directories, a typical arrangement for a Kubernetes cluster configuration.
     * Files are for general configuration files, also organized into application sub-directories. These may be embedded into other files using `valueFrom.file`.
     * Scripts are for executable scripts used to derive content for inclusion in manifests. Only scripts found in these directories will be permitted to run using `valueFrom.script`.
  
* Other `genifest.yaml` configurations found in these directories are loaded and merged into the top-level one before processing and applying changes.
* Changes are applied in-place, expecting the user to use version control to track changes as part of a gitops process.
* The system defines a simple tag-based scheme for choosing which changes to execute on each run.
* The following `valueFrom` types are defined:

    * `call` functions as a simple macro for calling other `valueFrom` expressions.
    * `pipeline` defines a way of chaining operations together so that the output from a previous step can feed into a following step
    * `file` embeds a file from a file directory into another YAML file
    * `template` allows for the creation of simple templates using `${var}` style interpolation
    * `script` executes custom scripts found in a scripts directory
    * `argRef` is used to read variables and arguments inside a `valueFrom` or function definition
    * `default` is used for literal values
    * `documentRef` is used to lookup values elsewhere in the current YAML document and use the looked up value

## v0.2.0  2025-07-17

 * The ddbLookup function in templates now supports `BOOL` fields and also nested fields with `M` (e.g., `Counter.M.prod.N`).
